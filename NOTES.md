# Notes

Thoughts and ideas about where this project is headed.

### Enemies
- Pulsating?
- Explode on contact?

### Desktop version
- Fancier graphics?
- Straight clone?
- Share levels between web & desktop?

### Gameplay
- Tunnels through levels?
- Powerups?
- Multiplayer mode?
- "coyote time" where you can turn a little later than right at the center of an intersection
- camera should slightly lead the player/be a little more fluid and not as stiff

### Art/graphics
- Mayan art
- Bold colors
- Stone
- Minimalist
- Hard lines
